===================
The tiny tots tee-ball league has 12 players who have jersey numbers 0 through 11. The coach wants a program into which he can type a player’s number and the number of bases the player got in a turn at bat (a number 0 through 4). Write a program that allows the coach to continually enter the values until 999 is entered. Store the statistics in a two dimensional array. At the end of a data entry session, display each player’s number and the number of 0-bases, 1-base, 2-base, and 3-base, and 4-base turns the player had. Display a separate count of the number of data-entry errors the coach makes (a player number greater than 11 or a number of bases greater than 4).
